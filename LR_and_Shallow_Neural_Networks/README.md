## Logistic Regression with a mind of Neural Network
Here I created a LR model by using forward and backward propagation with basic Gradient descent. A logistic regression model can be viewed as
a neuron, where we start the idea to build deep neural network.
* LR is a linear classifier, same as Softmax classifier
