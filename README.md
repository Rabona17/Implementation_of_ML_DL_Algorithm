# Implementation_of_ML-DL_Algorithm
This repo serves as my practice for the course [deeplearning specialization at deeplearning.ai](www.deeplearning.ai). The majority of codes(except for some helper codes that has nothing to do with ML) are written by Rab0na.
Build several DL model from scratch, topics include LR, DNN, CNN, ResNet, optimizers, initialization methods and regularization. Also includes some practice for Tensowflow and Keras.

## Specification
* Implemented a whole model (including initialization, regularization, BP, and different optimizers) for Deep Neural Network
* Optimizers that built from scratch include mini-batch GD, SGD, RMSprop, Adam
* Regularization methods that built form scratch include L1, L2, and Dropout
* Initialization methods include Xavier and He
