# Implementation_of_ML-DL_Algorithm
This repo serves as my practice for the course [deeplearning specialization at deeplearning.ai](www.deeplearning.ai). The majority of codes(except for some helper codes that has nothing to do with ML) are written by Yuan Gao.
Here I build several DL model from scratch, topics include LR, DNN, CNN, ResNet, optimizers, initialization methods and regularization. Also includes some practice for Tensowflow and Keras.

## Specification
* Implemented a whole model (including initialization, regularization, BP, and different optimizers) for Deep Neural Network
* Optimizers that built from scratch include mini-batch GD, SGD, RMSprop, Adam
* Regularization methods that built form scratch include L1, L2, and Dropout
* Initialization methods include Xavier and He
* Implemented building blocks for Convolutional Neural Network including padding, pooling layers, colvolution layers, FC layers, BP for pooling layers and BP for Conv layers
* Implemented Resnet with skipping step of 3 using Keras

## Todo
* YOLO
* LSTM, RNN and other nlp algos
