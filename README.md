# Implementation_of_ML-DL_Algorithm
Build several DL model from scratch, topics include LR, DNN, CNN, ResNet, optimizers, initialization methods and regularization. Also includes some practice for Tensowflow and Keras.

## Specification
* Implemented a whole model (including initialization, regularization, BP, and different optimizers) for Deep Neural Network
* Optimizers that built from scratch include mini-batch GD, SGD, RMSprop, Adam
* Regularization methods that built form scratch include L1, L2, and Dropout
* Initialization methods include
